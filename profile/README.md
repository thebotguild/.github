# Hello there, fellow human
Welcome to our guild! We are pleased with your visit.

## The member guidelines
We are still working in the main guidelines for our members, but surely it can resume in:
- Create and enhance #discord and #twitch bots.
- Provide the best bot-hosting solution for all crazy needs.
- Befriend all existing bots, in production or not.

## [The roBot Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics)
- (0) A **roBot** may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
- (1) A **roBot** may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
- (2) A **roBot** must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
- (3) A **roBot** must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

## The network
We will be releasing a #discord server in order to achieve most of that premises.
